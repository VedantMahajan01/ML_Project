# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical 
attributes using **Logistic Regression**. 
The dataset is analyzed for insights, visualized for better understanding, 
and a machine learning model is trained for prediction.

# Dataset Information
- **Features:**
  - `age` - Age of the person
  - `sex` - Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
  - `cp` - Chest pain type (0-3)
  - `trestbps` - Resting blood pressure
  - `chol` - Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
  - `fbs` - Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl, 1 = True, 0 = False)
  - `restecg` - Resting ECG results (0-2)
  - `thalach` - Maximum heart rate achieved
  - `exang` - Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - `oldpeak` - ST depression induced by exercise
  - `slope` - Slope of peak exercise ST segment (0-2)
  - `ca` - Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
  - `thal` - Thalassemia (0-3)

- **Target Variable (`target`):**
  - `1` → Person has **Heart Disease**
  - `0` → Person **does not** have Heart Disease

# Project Overview
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
- Developed a predictive model using Logistic Regression to classify individuals as having heart disease or not, based on medical attributes.
- Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature selection, and dataset splitting for training and testing.
- Achieved an accuracy of 85.12% on training data and implemented a predictive system to analyze new patient data.
- Utilized Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data analysis,data visualization, model training, and evaluation.
